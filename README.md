# DnDAutostatsheet : an automatic Statsheet for DnD 5e

## 🎯 Overview
This project contains a reworked, automated D&D 5e character sheet in PDF format.
The goal is to provide a lightweight, calculation-assisted sheet that automatically updates common stats such as:
- Ability modifiers
- Armor Class
- Skill bonuses (with Proficiency / Expertise)
- Hit Points
- Initiative
- Speed
- Saving throws
- Other derived stats

All logic is handled through embedded JavaScript stored in the PDF, visible in ```scripts.js```.

This sheet is designed to work on Linux using Master PDF Editor, but should also run in Adobe Acrobat without any issues.
